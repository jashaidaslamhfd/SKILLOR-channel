# PRIMARY ENGINE: Chatterbox (Resemble AI, MIT license - safe for a
# monetized channel).
#
# Why Chatterbox over Kokoro: Chatterbox can condition generation on the
# creator's approved voice reference, whereas Kokoro is a generic fallback
# voice. Its delivery controls let us keep narration clear and conversational
# instead of giving every scene an artificial dramatic tone.
#
# Lazy-loaded on first use (not at import time) so a missing pip install or
# a failed model download doesn't crash the whole pipeline before it even
# starts - _get_chatterbox() catches that, and every call in this file
# falls back to Kokoro per-segment if Chatterbox is unavailable or a
# specific generation call fails. One bad Chatterbox call should never take
# a whole video down.

# NATURAL YOUTUBE VOICE PROFILE
#
# Chatterbox's higher exaggeration values make delivery more theatrical and
# can also make it feel faster. That is useful for character acting, but it
# weakens speaker similarity for a creator's regular YouTube narration.
# These defaults deliberately favour a calm, clear, conversational delivery:
# natural energy, stable pronunciation and recognisable cloned identity.
# Every value can be overridden in .env / GitHub Actions secrets.
