src/analytics_updater.py

Standalone entrypoint for pulling REAL YouTube Analytics numbers into
output/video_history.json.

IMPORTANT: run this on a SEPARATE cron/GitHub Actions schedule from the
main pipeline (main.py) - e.g. once a day. YouTube Analytics data is not
available immediately after upload (usually needs 24-48h to populate),
so this only touches history entries that are already at least
`min_hours_old` (default 24h).

Requires the SAME OAuth env vars as uploader.py:
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, REFRESH_TOKEN
...and that REFRESH_TOKEN must additionally have been issued with the
`yt-analytics.readonly` scope (uploader.py's upload flow only needs
youtube.upload + youtube.force-ssl, so if your existing token was minted
before this feature, you'll need to re-consent once with the extra scope).

Usage:
    python src/analytics_updater.py

Example GitHub Actions cron (runs daily at 06:00 UTC):
    on:
      schedule:
        - cron: '0 6 * * *'
