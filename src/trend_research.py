# src/trend_research.py
"""
Lightweight, no-API-key trend research for the dark body/brain/mystery niche.

WHY THIS EXISTS:
niche_strategy.DARK_TOPICS was a small static list of ~10 topics picked with
random.choice() and no memory of what was already used - so the channel was
guaranteed to repeat topics every couple weeks. That hurts virality (YouTube/
Facebook suppress near-duplicate content) and it never reacts to what's
actually resonating with people right now.

This module pulls today's top posts from a few science/body-adjacent
subreddits via Reddit's public JSON endpoints (no auth, no API key needed),
filters them to ones relevant to this channel's niche, and cleans them into
short topic strings the same shape as DARK_TOPICS entries.

This is best-effort by design: if Reddit is unreachable, rate-limits, or
returns nothing usable, fetch_trending_topics() returns an empty list so the
caller (niche_strategy.get_random_topic) falls back to the static pool
instead of breaking the pipeline.
